The Scala interpreter is a dynamic and interactive tool that plays a pivotal role in the world of Scala programming. It offers developers an efficient and hands-on way to write, execute, and experiment with Scala code 
in a live environment. Scala, known for its conciseness and scalability, is a versatile language widely used in a range of applications, from web development to big data processing.
Key Features:

Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop): The Scala interpreter provides a Read-Eval-Print Loop environment, allowing developers to enter Scala code line by line and see immediate results. This interactive nature facilitates rapid prototyping and testing.

Code Exploration: Developers can explore libraries, frameworks, and language features in real-time, making it an excellent learning tool. This enables programmers to understand the behavior of Scala constructs without the need for extensive compilation and execution.

Rapid Prototyping: The interpreter is ideal for quick and iterative development. It allows developers to experiment with code snippets and algorithms swiftly, refining their solutions as they go.

Immediate Feedback: Any errors or exceptions are reported instantly, helping developers identify and rectify issues early in the development process.

Integrations: Many integrated development environments (IDEs) and text editors support Scala interpreters, making it easy to switch between writing code in an editor and testing it in the interpreter.

The following project is to create an interpreter for scala using the following Denotational Semantics:

<statement sequence> ::= <statement> ; {<statement> ;}
<statement> ::= <assignment statement> | <if statement> | <loop statement> |
<input statement> | <output statement>
<assignment statement> ::= <identifier> := <expression>
<if statement> ::=
if <comparison> then <statement sequence> [else <statement>] end if
<while statement> ::= while <comparison> loop <statement sequence> end loop <input statement> ::= input <identifier>
<output statement> ::= output <identifier>
<comparison> ::= ( <factor> <comparison operator> <factor> )
<expression> ::= <term> {<add operator> <term>} <term> ::= <factor> {* <factor>}
<factor> ::= ( <expression> ) | <identifier> | <integer> <comparison operator> ::= < | <= | = | <> | > | >= <add operator> ::= + | â€“
